# Team 'Rookies' (Sarah, Simon, Natalie & Jess)

# Project: WeBeTrippin


## User Stories
- I can click a drop down menu to find a country and city
- I can look for attractions in a city that I'm planning to visit
- I can add my own city
- I can add my own attraction

## MVP
- A user can visit our app, click on a menu which will reveal a drop down list of countries, they then click on a country and this reveals another drop down list cities. The user then selects a city, which shows a list of attractions available in that city.

## Method
- Complete wireframes
- Complete file structure and install technologies
- Delegate roles
- Write memory data
- Write first feature tests
- Write first feature
- 

## Learning Objectives
- Natalie: Consolidate learning
- Jess: Building with less handholding
- Sarah: Improve understanding of react and redux
- Simon: Build understanding of react and redux, particularly stateful components


## Stretch 
- Include more options for each city
- Allow the user to add their own countries and cities
